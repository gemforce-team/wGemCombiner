WGemCombiner
========

In-game gem combiner bot for [Gemcraft 2: Chasing Shadows](http://gameinabottle.com/).


### Get WGemCombiner:

Head to the [Release page](https://github.com/gemforce-team/wGemCombiner/releases) to download the last version of the program.  
WGemCombiner depends on .NET framework >= 4.5, included on all the newer versions of Windows.

#### Supported operating systems:

* Windows: from Vista to 10 (sorry XP users, complain to Microsoft about .NET versions)
* Others: wine can run it, but it may not send keyboard/mouse events correctly

#### Supported Gemcraft versions:

* Browser: all major browsers supported, zoom level MUST be 100%:
    * Firefox: Disable [Flash protected mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/adobe-flash-protected-mode-firefox)
      for a large speed boost, best of all tested browsers
    * Chrome: Extensive sandboxing of the Flash player makes wGC very slow here, but it works
    * IE/Edge: Works
* Standalone Flash player: a pain to set up, but running the browser version here makes wGC much faster, zoom level MUST be 100%
* Steam: Supported at all resolutions

### How To:

You give a gem recipe (or use one of the preset ones), put base gems on the correct starting slots
and the program sends mouse/keyboard events to the system to perform it in game automatically.  
There is an extensive help inside the program.


### Administrator rights issue:

The program works by sending keystrokes to the Gemcraft window.  
In some systems this needs **administrator rights**.
If the program is not working, try to run it as Administrator and check if that was the problem.


### Report bugs:

To report a bug with wGemCombiner look at the
[Issues page on Github](https://github.com/gemforce-team/wGemCombiner/issues) if it was already reported.  
If your bug isn't there open a [new issue](https://github.com/gemforce-team/wGemCombiner/issues/new).
Be sure to include all the relevant information (OS, wGC version, etc...) and give a reliable way to reproduce the bug.
A video of the combiner in action could help immensely for bugs related to interaction with the game.
